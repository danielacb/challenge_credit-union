# Clutch Loan Application Challenge

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a technical challenge for an opening at Clutch. It simulates a simplified application flow for requesting a personal loan. The user fills out a loan request form, submits the application, and is then redirected to a confirmation page that displays up-sell opportunities for refinancing a car.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

I chose these technologies as they align with my expertise and allowed me to efficiently replicate the UI from the provided Figma design. Here's what was used:

- Vite: For a fast and modern development experience.
- React.js & TypeScript: To build scalable, type-safe, and maintainable components.
- MUI & Emotion: To closely match the provided UI design.
- React Router: For client-side navigation and to persist the `userId` between pages.
- React Hook Form & Zod: For form handling and schema validation.
- Jest & React Testing Library: For unit tests to ensure reliable component behavior.
- Cypress: For end-to-end testing to simulate real user interactions.
